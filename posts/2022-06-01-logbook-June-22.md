## Week 24 - June 22

**Wednesday 6/15**

* continue [deep rl class](/guillaume_blog/blog/deep-rl-class-with-huggingface.html) with unit 2, interesting notebook to learn about using optuna to tune hyperparameters

**Friday 6/17**

* Sylvain pointed me to a paper from X: [Robust Reinforcement Learning with Distributional Risk-averse formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06841) now in [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/guillaumeramelet/collections/P7DX6A6B/items/EB3XCB4Z/collection) to use distribution information to strengthen RL epxloration. To be read and tested
